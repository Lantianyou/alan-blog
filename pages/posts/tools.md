## AI

- Github Copilot, next (maybe this) generation software development
- Poe, AI chatbot integrator, with ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude (Google backed AI chatbot start-up) built in. Poe has a more smooth experience, with iOS client.
- Perplexity.ai, an AI search engine
- Phind, a AI search engine specialized for technical problem answering
- New Bing, AI search engine built by Microsoft and OpenAI
- Charater.ai, AI chatbot for celebrity, anemic characters and history figures

## Note Taking

- Notion, for presentation and AI guided writing.
- Mem.ai, for quick note taking and message passing across devices.
- Roam Research, for knowledge graph and long term note taking.

## Development

- Visual Studio Code, masterpiece software
- Zed, 120 FPS rendering high performance editor written in Rust, still in beta
- Vim, I work on both Mac and Ubuntu machines
- Warp, terminal simulator written in Rust with AI completion for commands

As a frontend developer, I use the following stack on a daily basis for seemingness workflow:

- Rome, formatter and linter written in Rust, blazing fast with extremely simple configuration. I found it does not have extensive rules like eslint, but I found eslint is insufferably slow and hard to configure.
- Vite, a development tool leveraging on ES module and esbuild, fast and less resource intensive compared to WebPack, easy to configure and migrate
- antd, not modern looking but handling edge case well
- tailwindcss, super short styling code, I found long styling code hard to read and reason
- pnpm, disk space saving and fast installation for packages
- Redux Toolkit, global state management and side effects, complex and separated data fetching logic, great documentation, predictable code and easy to debug. A must have for enterprise size front end project.
- React, a revolutionary library for building UI, a new way of thinking.
- TypeScript, strongly typed transpiler, LSP and type checking.

## macOS

- raycast, text based app launcher, clipboard management and (potentially) entry point for AI chat assistant
- IINA, a swift written open source video and audio player. State of art for macOS
- AirBuddy, fantastic looking bluetooth device manager and battery indicator. A must have if your switch between iPhone and MacBook constantly.
- Things, nice looking (expensive) to do Apps, but I prefer to remember stuff
- Magnet, macOS has terrible window management, you need a third party app to do it right

## Other Tools

- Cron, elegant calendar, acquired by Notion
- Spotify, I listen to music
- 微信读书，the only domestic app I enjoyed
- Google Photo, to manage photo, I do not have a girlfriend, so I have less photo to manage.
