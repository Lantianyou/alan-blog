Bingeing on TV shows are time consuming and will cause a great deal of guilt afterwards, however, they are necessaries. It is very sad the culture of waiting and watching a US TV show together has gradually died out.

The best TV shows in recent years I have watched is Better Call Saul. The best show I have ever watched is Newsroom, with Aaron Sorkin as author. The following is a list of shows I have watched, with a short comments or stories attached to it:

- Better Call Saul, masterpiece
- Newsroom
- Breaking Bad
- Game of Thrones
- Dark, a German show
- Billions
  -  I watched right in the time of the 2016 Gao Kao. The SM scene at the opening is arousing and sexually temping, especially for a 18-year-old boy. The dialogs and stories are also intensive. I have heart people join Wall Street after reading The Liar of Poker. This show is my Liar of Poker, encouraging me to join the financial industry. To accomplish this dream, I went to SUFE.
