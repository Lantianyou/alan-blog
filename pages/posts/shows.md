Bingeing on TV shows are time consuming and typically cause a great deal of guilt afterwards, however, they are necessaries. It is very sad the culture of waiting and watching a US TV show together has gradually died out.

看电视剧非常浪费时间，并且在事后感到无限的悔恨，但是，这是生活的必然组成成分。很可惜，中国的追剧文化已经逐渐消失了。

The best TV shows in recent years I have watched is Better Call Saul. The best show I have ever watched is Newsroom, with Aaron Sorkin as playwright. The following is a list of shows I have watched, with a short comments or stories attached to it:

近几年我看过最好看的美剧是风骚律师。我看过的最好看的剧集是新闻工作室，编剧是Aaron Sorkin。下面是我看过的剧集列表，每个剧集后面都有一些短评或者故事。

- Better Call Saul, 风骚律师

  masterpiece

- Newsroom, 新闻工作室
- Breaking Bad, 绝命毒师
- Game of Thrones, 权力的游戏
- Western World, 西部世界
- Dark(German), 暗黑（德剧）
- Billions, 亿万

  The show started at the year of my Gao Kao. The SM scene at the opening is arousing and sexually temping, especially for a 18-year-old boy. The dialogs and stories are also intensive. I have heart people join Wall Street after reading The Liar of Poker. This show is my Liar of Poker, encouraging me to join the financial industry. To accomplish this dream, I went to SUFE.
