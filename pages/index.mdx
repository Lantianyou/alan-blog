# 兰天游

Hey, My name is Lan Tianyou. I'm a Senior Software Engineer. I live and work in Shenzhen, Nanshan. I tweet a lot. I am a Blink(BLACKPINK fan). **SINGLE, a girl friend is in dire need**

你好，我叫兰天游。我是一名软件（高级😈）工程师。在深圳南山工作和生活。非常喜欢推特。BLACKPINK 粉丝。**单身**

I enjoy quite a bit TV shows, movies, and stand-up comedy. I watch financial shows as entertainment. I am bilingual, I speak both English and Chinese. I am fluent with React, Redux Toolkit as I use them on daily life. I am also comfortable with other programming languages, like Python, Rust and Go as I lean them on evening and weekends. Books are my favorite, as they enrich my life. I feel extremely excited about AI, I feel super pessimistic about macro economic headwind.

我很喜欢美剧，电影或者单口喜剧。我平时看金融新闻以做娱乐。我可以用英文和中文交谈。我很熟悉 React 和 Redux Toolkit，在日常工作生活中频繁使用。我也可以编写 Python, Rust 和 Go 程序，因为我在晚上和周末学习它们。我最喜欢看书，书籍可以丰富人生。我对人工智能感到异常激动，也对宏观经济的逆风感到异常沮丧。

I am overconfident and talkative, I believe I can have a fantastic chat with you if you are interested in me. A cup of coffee or dinner on weekends is always better than watching YouTube.

我过度自信并且话很多，如果你对我感兴趣，相信我们能聊得非常开心。休息日的咖啡和晚饭总是好过在 YouTube 闲逛。

I plan to write more.

我准备更详细得写下想法。
